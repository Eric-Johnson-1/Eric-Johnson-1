## 🧙‍♂️ Web3 Code Wizard | Smart Contract Alchemist | dApp Architect

When I'm not optimizing gas fees, I'm probably meditating on the next blockchain innovation or hiking somewhere with terrible WiFi but spectacular views.

## 🚀 What I Do

- **Smart Contract Sorcery**: Crafting secure, gas-optimized contracts that even Vitalik would nod approvingly at
- **Front-end Wizardry**: Building seamless dApp experiences with Next.js, Wagmi, and Viem that make Web3 accessible to everyone
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Designing systems that would make centralized services jealous (looking at you, AWS)
- **Gas Optimization**: Because nobody likes paying more ETH than necessary, especially not me!

## 🛠️ Recent Enchantments

### ✨ Staking Platform
Conjured a staking platform where your tokens work for you while you sleep. Integrated Chainlink oracles for reliable price feeds and Layer 2 solutions to keep those gas fees from burning a hole in your digital wallet.

### 🖼️ NFT Marketplace
Architected an NFT marketplace where digital artists can thrive. Implemented IPFS for decentralized storage because your digital art deserves better than a centralized server that could disappear tomorrow.

## 📊 GitHub Stats That Don't Tell The Whole Story

![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-activity-graph.vercel.app/graph?username=Eric-Johnson-1&theme=react-dark)

*Stats are cool, but they don't show the hours debugging a smart contract at 3 AM or the joy when you finally get that complex state management working just right.*

## 🧘‍♂️ When Not Coding...

You'll find me exploring nature, cycling through new cities, or deep in meditation trying to visualize Ethereum's state trie. Yes, I'm that kind of blockchain enthusiast!
